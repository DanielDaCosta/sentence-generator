# Natural Language Generator
Generates sentences based on numerical inputs, taking into account: sensitiveness and intensity of the data.

With this project you can build sentences like:
- Input: "number of people", 
- Old Data
- New Data
- Settings: object containing settings informations:
   * sensitiveness: sensitiveness of data,
   * threshold: minimum value to change level of data
   * precision: desired decimal places
   * dataType: group of the inserted data


Example: 
```
- Today, the number of people decreased reasonably to 2. Decrease of 60% in comparison to yestarday.
- There was an increase of 60% in the number of people counted today in comparison to yestarday. A variation from 5 to 8.
- There wasn't any considerable change in the number of people today. Stayed constant on 5 in comparison to yestarday.
```
